Node Package Manager. This is the name of the official CLI tool shipped along
with node.js for managing dependencies, as well as the name of the [official

## PR
Pull Request. To add contributions to a project on Github, you must fork it,
modify the files you want, commit and push your fork, and then send a Pull
Request back to the original repository, where your changes get reviewed and
then merged.

## SSR
Server Side Rendering. Execute a Javascript frontend on the server like a
browser would to and return the resulting HTML.

## VSCode
Visual Studio Code. The probably most popular code editor for web developers
specialised in JavaScript. Made by the same company that also created Typescript
(Microsoft), so there might be some synergies.
