# Updating this website

This is a website hosted on github pages, written in markdown files and
compiled via gitbook.

## getting started

You'll need node.js (>= 6) installed on your computer. You can then start the
ocal preview server with `npm run docs:watch`. When you're done editing,
compile the repository with `npm run docs:build` and commit all changes.

## file structure

- README.md is the first page and contains an introduction.
- SUMMARY.md contains the table of content, which is shown as a left slide menu.
